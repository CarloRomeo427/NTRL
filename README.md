Tired of your DM's "deadly" encounters being about as threatening as a fluffy kitten? Or the opposite, where a "medium" challenge accidentally turns into a TPK because the rulebook lied? This project is for you.

We've created an AI that went to the school of hard knocks‚Äîby running thousands of simulated D&D battles‚Äîto learn how to be the perfect Dungeon Master for combat. It designs challenging, tactical, and most importantly, *fun* encounters automatically.

## How It Works (It's not Skynet, we promise)

NTRL doesn't just count XP. It learned its craft using a **Reinforcement Learning** technique called **REINFORCE**. We framed the task as a **Contextual Bandit** problem, which is a fancy way of saying it's like a club bouncer who sizes up your party before deciding how many goblins to let inside.

The AI was trained by maximizing a special **reward function**‚Äîits personal philosophy on what makes combat awesome:
* ‚öîÔ∏è **Longevity is Key**: A great battle should be a multi-round epic, not a one-hit wonder.
* ü©∏ **Bring the Pain**: The party should feel the heat! It's rewarded for dealing damage and making players sweat (and use those healing potions).
* ‚ò†Ô∏è **Calculated Risks**: The AI aims for thrilling encounters where death is a possibility, but it gets a massive penalty for a **Total Party Kill (TPK)**. It wants drama, not a tragedy.

## The AI's Report Card üìà

So, what happens when you let a robot run the show? Glorious, well-balanced chaos.
* **Epic Sagas**: Fights last **+200%** longer, giving everyone a chance to shine.
* **Real Scrapes**: Parties finish with **-16.67%** fewer hit points, making victory feel earned.
* **Always Fair**: It maintains a consistently high **~70% win rate**. It's tough, not a cheater.
